# About
For decades, not only have exclusionary punishment practices forcibly removed children from educational opportunities and fueled the school-to-prison pipeline they have also indirectly negatively affected students who attend high-suspension rate schools. A broad range of studies have documented the suspension inequality that largely affects students of colour, students with disabilities, LGBTQ+ students and students from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods. In this study, I attempt to add to the current literature by exploring if any association between school expenditures and suspension rates exists. Although there is some relationship discovered, it is not the best fit model and therefore, causality cannot be found. In the later half of the paper, I discuss how causality can be found with the right study and a discussion on the necessary steps to lower suspension rates for the benefit of all students and staff.
