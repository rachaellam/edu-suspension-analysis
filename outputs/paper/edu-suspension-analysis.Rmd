# Introduction

Criminalizing youth

# Data

High school data includes schools who offer only grades 9-12. No schools are included that only offer partial grades (ex. 10-12)

Excluded:
Only using high school data (maybe include other analysis depending on length)
Raw data had over 1800 columns, so I removed all columns that were not necessary to the analysis including what types of classes are offered (algebra, geography, science, etc.).
Grouped all students, regardless of race, to sum all suspensions. This has some ethical issues. This could also change the analysis if race was included.
Disabilities

Part of the analysis:
1. Number of days missed due to suspension (TOT_DAYSMISSED) - Created this variable by summing total days missed for females (TOT_DAYSMISSED_F) and total days missed for males (OT_DAYSMISSED_M). I chose this because it speaks to the severity of the suspension. More days missed means the suspensions were for a longer period of time.
2. Salary expenditures for total personnel with and without federal funding (COST_PER_STUDENT_WFED/COST_PER_STUDENT_WOFED) - Created this variable by dividing the salary with the number of students to understand how much each school was spending per student. 
3. Amount of non-personnel expenditures associated with activities (COST_PER_STUDENT_NPE_WFED) - cost per student creation.
Might include variables that separate total personnel such as teachers, administration, support services, instructional aid)


# Model

Will be using multiple linear regression. Cannot use a diff in diff approach because there are not enough variables. Although school districts are available, they do not match records that I can find.
